		<p>Hello, my name is Jay C. Davé. I am an avid learner, in all aspects of life!! </p>

			<p>Throughout my life, for as long as I can remember, I have always been a problem solver. I recall getting super excited from something as simple as fixing a hair dryer with nothing more than a lighter and a paperclip, which was my claim to fame at a mere 10-years of age! I’ve since moved onto writing code and learning new technologies. Currently I am developing iOS applications!</p>

			<p>I also enjoy being outdoors and outdoor activites: hiking, climbing, running, & etc. I also enjoy travelling, to date I have been to a few exotic places. Thailand being my favorite! There was something so surreal about being free in the jungle and being able to walk barefoot, without any inhibitions. I will never forget that vacation, my first taste of truly immersing oneself in a different culture.</p>
